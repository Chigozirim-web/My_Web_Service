"song.htm" IS NOT OUR ACTUAL HTML FILE
I ONLY CREATED IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF TESTING THE PYTHON SERVER SCRIPT
AND MAKING SURE THE INSERTION WORKS

HOWEVER, THE OTHER HTML FILES HAVE TO BE MODIFIED TO HAVE A NAME ATTRIBUTE IN THE INPUT TAGS JUST LIKE IN THIS "song.htm" FILE

EG.:
 
 " 
 <form>
   .......
  <input ...... name="year" ......>
   ...... "
    
   or sth like that
